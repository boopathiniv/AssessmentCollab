# assessment
This repo has assessment with postman collection as well as karate script for the given scenarios.
I just created postman collection for the below scenarios
Scenario 1: 
Using https://gorest.co.in/public/v2/users
 Create a new employee entry with Name, Gender, Email and Status (active or inactive) 
Verify id returned is in numerical format
 Scenario 2:  
Using https://gorest.co.in/public/v2/users
 Verify status for first entry is only either "active" or "inactive"
